       "### How to Update Keyword Definitions\n\n"
       "1. **Edit the keywords map**: Open `keywords_map.clj` and update the definitions\n"
       "2. **Format**: Each keyword has three fields:\n"
       "   - `:kw` - The keyword name (don't change this)\n"
       "   - `:def` - Add a clear, concise definition\n"
       "   - `:use` - Describe where/how it's used (e.g., \"class, struct, func\")\n\n"
       "3. **Example**:\n"
       "   ```clojure\n"
       "   {:kw \"public\", :def \"Access level that allows entities to be used outside their module\", :use \"class, struct, func, var\"}\n"
       "   ```\n\n"
       "4. **Regenerate**: To generate file you need to have [babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka#installation) installed, to generate the latest README, \nrun the build script `bb gen.clj` to update the README\n\n"
       "### Guidelines\n\n"
       "- Keep definitions concise but informative\n"
       "- Include practical usage examples\n"
       "- Follow Swift's official terminology\n"
       "- Test your changes before submitting\n\n"
